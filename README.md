This method uses the [Amplicon sorter](https://github.com/avierstr/amplicon_sorter) pipeline output and create OTU and zOTU (ASV) tables using [USEARCH](https://drive5.com/usearch/) and [VSEARCH](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) commands that you already have a pipeline that you like to use for assembling your metagenomes and creating bins.  We like to use BBtools for trimming and read filtering, metaSPAdes for assembly, and MetaBat 2 for binning. What we describe here is steps D-G in the above figure
